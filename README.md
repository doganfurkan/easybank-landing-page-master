## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

In this challenge, I had figma files for the first time. Since I have the designs, I tried to make this website pixel-perfect.

### Useful resources

- [Filtering for svg images](https://codepen.io/sosuke/pen/Pjoqqp) - This helped me for social media icons. For their hover states, I used this website for the color change.
